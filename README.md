# Drawbacks
One potential drawback of the website is user error with typos.  For example, the user above could have misspelled San Diego to San Dego.  This would lead to the data not displaying correctly.
# Recommendations
•	One recommendation would be to include drop down lists in the filters and data validation.  This eliminates the potential error for user typos
•	Another recommendation would be to include an export to file option.  This can allow the user to export and save the data as an Excel, CSV, or PDF file
